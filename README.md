===========================================================
This project uses AspNet Identity 2.0 with Group-Based Permissions Management.

In this project, we make extensive addtions to the original Identity Samples project. We start with the easily extensible project template found at [AspNet Identity 2.0 Extensible Project Template](https://github.com/TypecastException/AspNet-Identity-2-Extensible-Project-Template) and add the capability to organize granular Role permissions into Groups, to which Users can then be assigned. 

There is a lot of room for improvment in this project. Particularly with respect to the design of Views and presentation. Do feel free to add to the issues list and/or hit me with a Pull Request if you have ideas or some code to add.
